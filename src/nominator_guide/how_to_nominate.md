6) Choose your validator, you can choose multiple validators. This choice is up to you. 

> ## WARNING
> For avoiding being <strong>slashed</strong> (aka <strong>loose money</strong>), choose wisely your validator !
> The validator need to have good uptime (99.99%) and good behaviour (see [How does slashing works ?](https://docs.pirl.io/migrate/in_brief.html#how-does-slashing-works-) for more info about slashing).
> The list below is purely indicative and not a recommandation.

> ## Info
> Rewarding system work as follow :
>
> Validator are reward by block reward + 20% transaction fee. <strong>This do not depend on stake amount ! </strong>
>
> Validator take a % commision (you can see that info in [staking overview](https://explorer.pirl.network/#/staking))
